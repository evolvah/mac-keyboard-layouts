Keyboard layouts for OS X and alike

# Content
`Russian - PC - Yo.bundle` adds the Cyrillic letter "Ñ‘" to the tilde/backtick key. This is the way it normally is in traditional Cyrillic layout on Windows. It helps to work around Qt-based interfeces that do not support the long-press to choose an alternate character.

# Installation
Clone the repo and then copy the desired bundle into `~/Library/Keyboard Layouts` if you want to make it available to one user only. Then, go into Keyboard settings and add the corresponding input source.
